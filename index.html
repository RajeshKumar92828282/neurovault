    <!-- Debugging note: Vite's `base` affects where built assets are referenced.
         If you see 404s for built assets (e.g. "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404"),
         check `vite.config.ts` and set `VITE_BASE='/neurovault/'` (or adjust to your repo path) before building.
         During development we use a relative module entry below to make dev server and page base compatible. -->

    <!-- Use a relative path here so the module resolves correctly when served under a repo base.
         Vite will rewrite asset paths during build according to `base` (vite.config.ts).
         If you still get a 404 on main.tsx in production, set VITE_BASE prior to building. -->
