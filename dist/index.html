        <!-- Debugging note: Vite's `base` affects where built assets are referenced.
          When building, Vite replaces the placeholder `/neurovault/` with the configured base (see vite.config.ts).
          For GitHub Pages under the `neurovault` repo set `VITE_BASE='/neurovault/'` before building.
          Example: `VITE_BASE='/neurovault/' npm run build`.
          During development the dev server uses a relative path so the app loads correctly locally. -->

        <!-- Use the BASE_URL placeholder so Vite replaces it at build time. When serving the built
          site from GitHub Pages or a sub-path, this ensures the assets are requested from the correct base.
          NOTE: /neurovault/ is replaced by Vite during build (it becomes e.g. '/neurovault/'). -->
